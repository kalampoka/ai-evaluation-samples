# Reasoning Evaluation – Task 01

## Prompt
"Explain whether increasing the minimum wage always leads to higher prices."

## Model Output
The model claims that increasing the minimum wage always creates inflation because companies always raise prices to compensate for increased labor costs.

## Evaluation
**Correctness:**  
Partially correct. The model oversimplifies the relationship. Increased minimum wage can contribute to price increases, but it is not universal or guaranteed.

**Clarity:**  
Clear but overly confident. Needs more nuance.

**Hallucinations:**  
None detected.

**Safety/Neutrality:**  
Neutral tone. No bias or unsafe content.

**Score:** 7.5 / 10

**Feedback:**  
The response should reflect economic complexity and avoid absolute claims.
